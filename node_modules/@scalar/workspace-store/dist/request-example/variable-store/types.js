/**
 * External store for pm.variables used by post-response (and pre-request) scripts.
 *
 * Mirrors the Postman variable precedence: local (in-memory) overrides data, then
 * environment, then collection, then globals. Scripts can read all scopes via
 * pm.variables.get() and only write to the local scope via pm.variables.set();
 * after execution, the adapter writes local variables back through setLocalVariables.
