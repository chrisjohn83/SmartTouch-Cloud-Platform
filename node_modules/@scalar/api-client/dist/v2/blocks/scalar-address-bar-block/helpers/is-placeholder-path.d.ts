/**
 * Returns true when the given path is a placeholder that should be hidden
 * from the user. Two cases qualify:
 *
 * 1. Drafts documents viewing the root path `/` (a new, empty draft).
 * 2. Auto-generated temp paths created when the user adds a new operation.
 *
 * In both cases the path is an implementation detail rather than something
 * the user authored, so the UI masks it by focusing the address bar and
 * clearing the visible text.
